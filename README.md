**All Free Features**
The **Headers Security Advanced & HSTS WP** version includes all the free features.

We have implemented **FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts)**, using best practices. First, using **Headers Security Advanced & HSTS WP** prevents the browser from including your site in the "cohort calculation" on **FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts)**. This means that nothing can call document.interestCohort() to get the FLoC ID of the currently used client. Obviously, this does nothing outside of your currently visited site and does not "disable" FLoC on the client beyond that scope.

Even though **FLoC** is still fairly new and not yet widely supported, as programmers we think that privacy protection elements are important, so we choose to give you the feature of being opt out of FLoC! We’ve created a special **“automatic blocking of FLoC”** feature, trying to always **offer the best tool with privacy protection and cyber security** as main targets and focus.

Analyze your site before and after using *Headers Security Advanced & HSTS WP* security headers are self-configured according to HTTP Security Headers and HTTP Strict Transport Security / HSTS best practices.
